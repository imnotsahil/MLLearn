    "A decision tree is essentially a series of if-then statements, that, when applied to a record in a data set, results in the classification of that record. Therefore, once you've created your decision tree, you will be able to run a data set through the program and get a classification for each individual record within the data set. What this means to you, as a manufacturer of quality widgets, is that the program you create from this article will be able to predict the likelihood of each user, within a data set, purchasing your finely crafted product."

    "# How decision tree works\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The understanding level of Decision Trees algorithm is so easy compared with other classification algorithms. The decision tree algorithm tries to solve the problem, by using tree representation. Each internal node of the tree corresponds to an attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree Algorithm Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Place the best attribute of the dataset at the root of the tree.\n",
    "   * Split the training set into subsets. Subsets should be made in such a way that each subset contains data with the same value for an attribute.\n",
    "   * Repeat step 1 and step 2 on each subset until you find leaf nodes in all the branches of the tree.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree classifier\n",
    "In decision trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with record’s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue comparing our record’s attribute values with other internal nodes of the tree until we reach a leaf node with predicted class value. As we know how the modeled decision tree can be used to predict the target class or the value. Now let’s understanding how we can create the decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions while creating Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The below are the some of the assumptions we make while using Decision tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * At the beginning, the whole training set is considered as the root.\n",
    "   * Feature values are preferred to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model.\n",
    "   * Records are distributed recursively on the basis of attribute values.\n",
    "   * Order to placing attributes as root or internal node of the tree is done by using some statistical approach.\n"

As we saw earlier, generating predictions on the training data itself to check the model's accuracy does not work very well: a complex model may fit the training data extremely closely but fail to generalize to new, unseen data. We can get a better sense of a model's expected performance on unseen data by setting a portion of our training data aside when creating a model, and then using that set aside data to evaluate the model's performance. This technique of setting aside some of the training data to assess a model's ability to generalize is known as validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holdout validation and cross validation are two common methods for assessing a model before using it on test data. Holdout validation involves splitting the training data into two parts, a training set and a validation set, building a model with the training set and then assessing performance with the validation set. In theory, model performance on the hold-out validation set should roughly mirror the performance you'd expect to see on unseen test data. In practice, holdout validation is fast and it can work well, especially on large data sets, but it has some pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserving a portion of the training data for a holdout set means you aren't using all the data at your disposal to build your model in the validation phase. This can lead to suboptimal performance, especially in situations where you don't have much data to work with. In addition, if you use the same holdout validation set to assess too many different models, you may end up finding a model that fits the validation set well due to chance that won't necessarily generalize well to unseen data. Despite these shortcomings, it is worth learning how to use a holdout validation set in Python."

    "### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a practical problem while building a decision tree model. The model is having an issue of overfitting is considered when the algorithm continues to go deeper and deeper in the to reduce the training set error but results with an increased test set error i.e, Accuracy of prediction for our model goes down. It generally happens when it builds many branches due to outliers and irregularities in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two approaches which we can use to avoid overfitting are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Pre-Pruning\n",
    "   * Post-Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pre-Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "In pre-pruning, it stops the tree construction bit early. It is preferred not to split a node if its goodness measure is below a threshold value. But it’s difficult to choose an appropriate stopping point.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Post-Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "In post-pruning first, it goes deeper and deeper in the tree to build a complete tree. If the tree shows the overfitting problem then pruning is done as a post-pruning step. We use a cross-validation data to check the effect of our pruning. Using cross-validation data, it tests whether expanding a node will make an improvement or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it shows an improvement, then we can continue by expanding that node. But if it shows a reduction in accuracy then it should not be expanded i.e, the node should be converted to a leaf node.\n",

    "### Decision Tree Algorithm Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Decision Trees are easy to explain. It results in a set of rules.\n",
    "   * It follows the same approach as humans generally follow while making decisions.\n",
    "   * Interpretation of a complex Decision Tree model can be simplified by its visualizations. Even a naive person can understand logic.\n",
    "   * The Number of hyper-parameters to be tuned is almost null.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * There is a high probability of overfitting in Decision Tree.\n",
    "   * Generally, it gives low prediction accuracy for a dataset as compared to other machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "   * Information gain in a decision tree with categorical variables gives a biased response for attributes with greater no. of categories.\n",
    "   * Calculations can become complex when there are many class labels."
